## Maintenance

I updated the version of Docusaurus that had several vulnerabilities and fixed some typos in the docs.
The README also got some love. There was some error here as well.

## Intentions

For the past few years, I've been using Tailwind as a library to style the projects I create.
With all the experience I've accumulated I see potential improvements for this library.
I think it deserves a better developer experience.
