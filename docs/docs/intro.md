# Overview

## Inspiration

I wanted to try to use styled-components and I have always seen the lack of a simple HTML grid package. So, inspired by Bootstrap and other similar frameworks I wrote this little library. 

The opportunity to create it was a Python Italia retreat, it was 2018. 

I have never promoted the library that much but over time various people have continued to try it. In 2021 I wanted to give it a dusting.
